  This page is for sharing thoughts/ideas that I had and thought were interesting and or wanted to share. But did not have enough substance to write a larger work about.<br><br>
  We often think of failure in a negative light--we messed up, didn't do whatever it was right, and thus did not get our desired result. And since we're not getting our desired result, we're not progressing.
  However, I think the opposite here is true--achieving the desired result is not progress, but the failure is. When you are failing, you are trying to learn something. When one thing doesn't work, you try another thing.
  You keep doing this until you figure it out. Once you finally figure it out, you're rewarded with the desired result. That desired result is a reward for the progress you made. You don't progress by reaching the goal you had or by getting the end result you wanted.
  You progress by failing and trying to figure out how to get it right.
