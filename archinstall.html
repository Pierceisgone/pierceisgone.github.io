  Hello, this is an Arch Linux installation tutorial designed for new Linux users<br>
  who want to jump head first into a DIY Linux distrobution. This guide assumes you<br>
  already know what specs your PC, that you know what CPU architecture you have,<br>
  and that you already have the live installation image flashed onto a USB flash<br>
  drive. If you do not know about your PCs hardware specifications, or do not<br>
  know how to flash the live installation image to a USB drive, please see the<br>
  pre-steup guide(ADD LINK)<br><br>
  To start off, you will need to powerdown/shutdown your computer. When it is off<br>
  plug in youe USB drive, and then power it back on. Most PCs should have their<br>
  boot priority set to boot from the USB drive first. However, you may still <br>
  need to go into your BIOS/UEFI and disable Secure Boot.<br><br>
