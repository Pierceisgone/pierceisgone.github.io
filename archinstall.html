  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  Hello, this is an Arch Linux installation tutorial designed for new Linux users<br>
  who want to jump head first into a DIY Linux distrobution. This guide assumes you<br>
  already know what specs your PC, that you know what CPU architecture you have,<br>
  and that you already have the live installation image flashed onto a USB flash<br>
  drive. If you do not know about your PCs hardware specifications, or do not<br>
  know how to flash the live installation image to a USB drive, please see the<br>
  pre-steup guide(ADD LINK)<br><br>
  To start off, you will need to powerdown/shutdown your computer. When it is off<br>
  plug in youe USB drive, and then power it back on. Most PCs should have their<br>
  boot priority set to boot from the USB drive first. However, you may still <br>
  need to go into your BIOS/UEFI and disable Secure Boot.<br><br>

 Once booted, check to make sure your internet connection is working by running:<br>
  <code>ping https://archlinux.org/</code><br><br>
  <h1>Partitioning the disk</h1><br>
  WARNING: Make sure any and all data is backup from your drives before<br>
  proceeding. Once you repartion and reformat the drives, they will be<br>
  wiped entirely.<br><br>
  If you're system has multiple drives, I would reccommend disconnecting all<br>
  of them except for the drive you want to use as a boot drive. This will make<br>
  things easier. And this guide will continue assuming you only have one drive installed.<br><br>
  First off, list your drives with <code>lsblk</code>. If you're using an NVMe drive,<br>
  it should be called <code>nvme0n1</code>. If you're on a SATA drive, it should say <code>sda1</code>.<br><br>
  To start partitioning, run <code>cfdisk /dev/YOUR_DRIVE</code>. Next, create a new<br>
  partition, and set the size to <code>300M</code>. Then mark the partition as bootable.<br>
  You can do this by pressing B with the partition selected.<br>
  You can optionally make a swap partition. While not required, I would reccomend making one.<br>
  Simply create a new partion. Ideally you should make it as big as a quater of your RAM.<br>
  E.g. if you have 16GB of RAM, you should make the swap partition size <code>4G</code>.<br>
  However, you can make it bigger (Or smaller) if you feel the need.<br>
  Next, create your root partition. Unless you need any additional partitions, simply<br>
  allocate any remaining space to it.<br><br>

  <h1>Installation</h1><br>
  This will install the base system. However, it will be lacking a lot of<br>
  useful tools. We will install some extra software later--e.g. a text editor,<br>
  browser, and DE (Desktop Enviornment). Run:<br> 
  <code>pacstrap -K /mnt linux linux-firmware base base-devel</code><br>
  While <code>base-devel</code> isn't necessary, it can be useful to have, so I<br>
  reccomend install it too.<br><br>
  <h1>Generating the <code>fstab</code> file</h1><br>
  The <code>fstab</code> file is used to mount your disks upon boot.<br>
  WARNING: It is important that you use the <code>-U</code> argument here.<br>
  You want the drives to be recognised by UUID. This is because the name of<br>
  the drive my change if a disk is added/removed, or dies.<br>
  Going by UUID will prevent issues of the wrong drive being mounted to the<br>
  wrong directoy.<br><br>
  To generate the <code>fstab</code> file, run <code>genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab</code><br>
