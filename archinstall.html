  <h1>Introduction</h1><br>
  Hello, this is an Arch Linux installation tutorial designed for new Linux users
  who want to jump head first into a DIY Linux distrobution. This guide assumes you
  already know what specs your PC, that you know what CPU architecture you have,
  and that you already have the live installation image flashed onto a USB flash
  drive. If you do not know about your PCs hardware specifications, or do not
  know how to flash the live installation image to a USB drive, please see the
  pre-steup guide(ADD LINK)<br><br>
  To start off, you will need to powerdown/shutdown your computer. When it is off
  plug in youe USB drive, and then power it back on. Most PCs should have their
  boot priority set to boot from the USB drive first. However, you may still
  need to go into your BIOS/UEFI and disable Secure Boot.<br><br>

 Once booted, check to make sure your internet connection is working by running:<br>
  <code>ping https://archlinux.org/</code><br><br>
  <h1>Partitioning the disk</h1><br>
  WARNING: Make sure any and all data is backup from your drives before
  proceeding. Once you repartion and reformat the drives, they will be
  wiped entirely.<br><br>
  If you're system has multiple drives, I would reccommend disconnecting all
  of them except for the drive you want to use as a boot drive. This will make
  things easier. And this guide will continue assuming you only have one drive installed.<br><br>
  First off, list your drives with <code>lsblk</code>. If you're using an NVMe drive,
  it should be called <code>nvme0n1</code>. If you're on a SATA drive, it should say <code>sda</code>.
  If installing on a virtual machine, it should either be <code>sda</code> or <code>vda</code><br><br>
  To start partitioning, run <code>cfdisk /dev/YOUR_DRIVE</code>. Next, create a new
  partition, and set the size to <code>300M</code>. Then mark the partition as bootable.
  You can do this by pressing B with the partition selected.
  You can optionally make a swap partition. While not required, I would reccomend making one.
  Simply create a new partion. Ideally you should make it as big as a quater of your RAM.
  E.g. if you have 16GB of RAM, you should make the swap partition size <code>4G</code>.
  However, you can make it bigger (Or smaller) if you feel the need.
  Next, create your root partition. Unless you need any additional partitions, simply
  allocate any remaining space to it.<br><br>
  
  <br><br>
  <h1>Installation</h1><br>
  This will install the base system. However, it will be lacking a lot of<br>
  useful tools. We will install some extra software later--e.g. a text editor,<br>
  browser, and DE (Desktop Enviornment). Run:<br> 
  <code>pacstrap -K /mnt linux linux-firmware base base-devel</code><br>
  While <code>base-devel</code> isn't necessary, it can be useful to have, so I<br>
  reccomend installing it too.<br><br>
 <h2>Configuring the system</h2><br><br>
  The <code>fstab</code> file is used to mount your disks upon boot.<br>
  WARNING: It is important that you use the <code>-U</code> argument here.<br>
  You want the drives to be recognised by UUID. This is because the name of<br>
  the drive my change if a disk is added/removed, or dies.<br>
  Going by UUID will prevent issues of the wrong drive being mounted to the<br>
  wrong directoy.<br><br>
  To generate the <code>fstab</code> file, run <code>genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab</code><br><br>
  Now, <code>chroot</code> into the new system with <code>arch-chroot /mnt</code><br><br>
  At this point you will now need a text editor. Run <code>pacman -S nano</code><br>
  This guide will be using GNU nano, however, you may use whatever your preffered text editor is.<br><br>
  Now we need to generate locals for the system, to do this run <code>nano /etc/locale.gen</code><br>
  Next, find <code>en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8</code> and uncomment it. You do this by removing the <code>#</code> at the start of the line.<br>
  You should also uncomment any other locales you may need. E.g. <code>ja_JP.EUC-JP EUC-JP</code> and <code>ja_JP.UTF-8 UTF-8</code> for Japanese.<br>
  Next, run <code>locale-gen</code> to generate the locales. Then edit <code>/etc/locale.conf</code> with nano, and type <code>LANG=en_US.UTF-8</code><br><br>
  Set a root password by running <code>passwd</code><br><br>

  Now it's time to make a user!
