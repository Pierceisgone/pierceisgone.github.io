  <center><h1>A year of using Linux--my experience</h1></center><br><br>
  Hi, a little over a year ago I started using Linux as my daily driver. I wanted to share my experiences using it, switiching to it, and adapting to it.<br><br>

  <center><h2>What is/isn't this article?</h2></center><br><br>
  This article is NOT an educational article. This is not a beginners guide, How To, or tutorial.<br><br>
  This article is NOT a "Why you should use/switch-to Linux" article. I am not trying to convice you to switch--I am just sharing my experiences here.<br><br>
  This article is NOT a "What distro should I pick?" article. I will go over what distro I use, and why I like it. But this article isn't a recommendation for it, or any other distro for that matter.<br><br>
  This article IS about my experiences using Linux as a daily driver, coming from being a Windows(10) user.<br><br>

  <center><h2>How did I find out about Linux?</h2></center><br><br>
  I was introduced to Linux through SomeOrdinaryGamers. I watched his videos on Linux and I thought it was a really cool concept--a completely free and open-source operating system. There's tons and tons of distros, all with different principles, goals, 
  and philosophies. Yet, they all use the same base (The Linux kernel), and often use similar utilities--E.g. GNUTils, Systemd, Bash, etc. But you also don't even need to use those. A Linux system can be setup however you want. You replace Systemd, you can use ZSH or
  Fish instead of Bash. And while I'm not aware of any real/good alternatives to GNUtils, I'm sure alternatives do exist. There's even alternatives to something as simple as sudo, a tool used to run commands with root permissions.<br><br>

  My operating system could be whatever I wanted it to be. It could be something easy to setup that does a lot of the work for me. Or I could do something completely DIY. You can even do the entire system from scratch if you go the LFS route.<br><br>

  And this isn't even getting into Desktop Environments (DEs)/Window Managers (WMs) and ricing. There is just so much flexability, and so many things you could try. And so many different utilities. It's feels really freeing in comparison to something like Windows.
  There is jsut so much more you can customize and change to your liking. And if you don't wanna do that either, that's cool to. You can just grab something that works out of the box and leave it as is. DEs will often come with a suite of utilities to go with it.
  Even just a base install should give you most if not all the utilities you need.<br><br>

  <center><h2>Where did you start? What was your first distro?</h2></center><br><br>
  The first distro I ever tried was Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine (VM). However it was only for about 15-20 minutes, and I didn't really care fot it. Sometime after I setup Arch in a VM, and I have been using it since. And would consider it my real first distro.
  I have tested some other distros in a VMs. But Arch is the only one I've used on an actual system.
