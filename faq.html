  Technically not an FAQ since nobody asked, but here you go:

  <h3>Q: What is this site for?</h3><br>
  A: It's a place for me to put random stuff.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: Can I request a video be added to videorepo?</h3><br>
  A: Sure. Send an email.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What is helloworld for?</h3><br>
  A: It's a place to put messages from people I know.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: Can I request a message to be put in helloworld?</h3><br>
  A: No. But if you say something funny and I like it I might add it anyways.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What animation software do you use?</h3><br>
  A: I use Blender.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What operating system do you use?</h3><br>
  A: I use Arch Linux and Windows.<br><br>
  <h3>"Hi, are you still looking for game devs?"</h3><br>
  A: No. The Assault Project has been dead for a long time now.<br>
  I am still working on GrayScale on my own occasionally.<br>
  Though it'll stil be a while before it's near ready.<br>
  You can still reach out if you're interested in helping, but this porject is not very active.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What happened to the Assualt Project?</h3><br>
  A: I tried to run a game development team/studio without any funding or real leadership skills.<br>
  It never really got anywhere, and it was evntualy cancelled.<br>
  Attempts at other games were made, but the team inevitably dissolved.<br><br>
  <h3>Do you want to try making another dev team at some point?</h3><br>
  A: No. At least not on Roblox. After the Talent-Hub fiasco, finding devs on Roblox is even harder.<br>
  And I feel it's a lossed cause unless you already have friends in the Roblox developer community.<br>
