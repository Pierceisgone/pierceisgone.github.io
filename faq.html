  <center>Technically not an FAQ since nobody asked, but here you go:</center>

  <h3>Q: What is this site for?</h3><br>
  A: Both a blog and a palce for me to post random things I think are interesting.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: Can I request a video be added to videorepo?</h3><br>
  A: Sure. Send an email.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What is helloworld for?</h3><br>
  A: It's a place to put messages from people I know.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: Can I request a message to be put in helloworld?</h3><br>
  A: No. But if you say something funny and I like it I might add it anyways.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What animation software do you use?</h3><br>
  A: I use Blender.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What operating system do you use?</h3><br>
  A: I primarily use Arch Linux and Windows 10.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: "Hi, are you still looking for game devs?"</h3><br>
  A: No. The Assault Project has been dead for a long time now. 
  I am still working on GrayScale on my own occasionally. 
  Though it'll stil be a while before it's near ready. 
  You can still reach out if you're interested in helping, but this porject is not very active.<br><br>
  <h3>Q: What happened to the Assualt Project?</h3><br>
  A: I had no gamedev experience and tried to form a dev-team, as well as having no funding. 
  that is obviously a recipe for disater, lol. Attempts at other games were made, but the team inevitably dissolved.<br><br>
  <h3>Do you want to try making another dev team at some point?</h3><br>
  A: No. At least not on Roblox. After the Talent-Hub fiasco, finding devs on Roblox is even harder. And I feel it's really difficult to make a game
  unless you already know other devs on Roblox. 
  If you're interested, I wrote a rant about this, <a href="/talenthubrant">here.</a>
