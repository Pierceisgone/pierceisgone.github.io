  <center><h1>Tiling Window Managers</h1></center><br>
  A few months ago I decided to give a tiling window manager a try. Up until this point, I'd only used a floating window manager. I came to Linux from Windows, and had been using KDE for a good while as it was a familiar experience.  
  I had messed with DWM and AwesomeWM in a VM prior, but never actually daily drove either of them. Eventually though, I decided I really wanted to give a tiling WM a shot. A lot of people seem to like them, so they must be good right? 
  Since I am a Wayland user, I went with Hyprland. I was aware of other Wayland WMs like Wayfire, Sway, and DWL. However I'd hear about Hyprland the most and so I went with it. Here's what my experience was using it:

  It didn't take long to get used to using tiling instead of floating. And I came to like tiling pretty quickly. I feel like it forces me to keep myself organized, and I noticed almost immediately I started closing things I wasn't using more. Random Firefox window 
  with like 20-40 tabs that I just left floating around (Pun intended) in the background? Nope. It made me more conscious of screen space, and I couldn't just let random windows get covered by the other windows and forget about them anymore.
